# Rapid Assessment Tools
United Nation Project: 
Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) of national planning documents using machine-based text analysis.

Examples
--------

These are some examples of how some organizations have evaluated "MANUALLY" national development plans.

The objective of this project is to conduct a similar analysis but using a computer (COMPUTER-ASSISTED). The computer-assisted analysis will serve as a rapid analysis of a national plan which then can be refined by humans.

>**This is "Rapid Integrated Assessment" for the SDGs for Bhutan. It analyses only one document " is exactly the kind of analysis we seek to reproduce:**
>
>Human Analysis 1: **- [RIA - template 1 - Bhutan](https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RIA_Bhutan_Key_Observations-18.12.2015.pdf)**  
>Human Analysis 2: **- [RIA - template 2 - Bhutan](https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RIA-Bhutan-Template-2-SDG-Profile-excluding-Goal-14-29.10.2015_final-1.pdf)**  
>Document Analyzed: **- [Bhutan 5 year Development Plan](http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Eleventh-Five-Year-Plan.pdf)**

This paper mentions a couple of examples of Rapid Integrated Assessments.

World Bank:
These papers by World Bank staff look at the national plans for a specific country and prepare a 3 page summary.
###Note that these documents below do not compare the national plans to the Sustainable Development Goals, which is the objective of this project.
